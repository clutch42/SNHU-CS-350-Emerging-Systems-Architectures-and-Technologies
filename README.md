# SNHU-CS-350-Emerging-Systems-Architectures-and-Technologies
## Course Description
Students will explore emerging systems, architectures, and technologies. Students will be 
provided with an in-depth evaluation of emerging system architecture focusing on performance 
and the software/hardware interface. Emphasis is on analyzing fundamental issues in 
architecture design and the impact on application performance to enable better understanding 
of the concepts. Students will learn to evaluate software architectures, both established and 
emerging, and gain experience in determining when to implement architectures and 
technologies to fulfill business needs.
## Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills 
relevant to your field:
- Write interface software to control hardware components
- Analyze fundamental considerations regarding hardware architecture design and their 
impact on application performance
- Recommend and justify emerging systems architectures and technologies based on 
business requirements

## Project
I put the different milestones and project for this class into seperate branches.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. This project was to create a prototype for a thermostat that uses 2 buttons to increase and decrease the target temperature, a light to indicate whether the heater is on or off, and uses the UART to simulate sending data to a cloud application through Wi-Fi.

What did you do particularly well? I think I kept the code simple and easy to read, allowing for it to easily be used by others.

Where could you improve? I broke the code down into many different functions so it was easy to read and understand. However this could be improved more by creating header files and putting the functions into their own files so that they could be used by other programs.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? I had no experience with programming embedded systems before this class, so I added PWM, UART, GPIO, interrupts, timers, and UART to the skills that I have some experience in now.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? I think all the skills will be applicable in some way, but learning how to create a state machine in C is probably the most transferable.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Besides the ways I mentioned earlier, I followed the 10 steps for coding best practices given to us by Professor Esposito.
